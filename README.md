Personal Web Development Challenges

These are projects in which I attempt to copy sample webpages without looking at HTML/CSS code.
While they are not 1-to-1, I get as close as visually possible.

# News Page:
This is my first project in the series. The sample page can be found at the link below:

## Challenges and Learning
Getting familiarized with tools like 'flex' and 'grid' were the largest hurdles I had to overcome. 
I made use of online resources and documentation to implement them as intended. 
My favorite part of learning was when being able to put my research skills to use and help myself understand.


# Coffee Confirmation Page:
This is my second project. The sample page can be found at the link below:
https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/project-files/coffee/index.html
## Challenges and Learning
'flex' and 'grid' were a bit tricky to implement given the varying locations and sizes of elements. 
However, the largest challenge was getting the user input areas close to the source page. I solved this by researching what css could be applied to the input fields and how to stretch them to fit the window they were in.
My favorite part was implementing border-radius to give windows and input-fields a cleaner look.
